# Front-End Developer Trial Task: Immersive Cinematic UI

## Objective
Your goal is to showcase your ability to build a modern, non-standard, and interactive user interface. We want to see your problem-solving skills and your eye for detail in creating polished, engaging web experiences.

## The Task
Reproduce the core user interface and scroll-driven experience of this cinematic website:
**[https://wakanda-forever-master.dogstudio-dev.co/zerolimits](https://wakanda-forever-master.dogstudio-dev.co/zerolimits)**

Your solution should be as close as possible to the original in terms of layout, typography, and animations.

## The Creative Challenge (Replacing the 3D)
The original site is built around a complex 3D animation. **You are not required to replicate the 3D model.**

Instead, we want you to creatively replace it with a solution that maintains the site's immersive and cinematic feel. This is where you can demonstrate your problem-solving skills. Some ideas include:

*   A high-quality, looping video background (AI-generated or stock).
*   An abstract generative animation using CSS, Canvas, or WebGL (e.g., particles, shaders).
*   A clever parallax effect with 2D image layers.
*   Any other creative solution you think fits the aesthetic.

## Key Areas to Focus On

*   **Scroll-driven Animations:** The synchronization of scrolling with element transitions (fade, move, scale) is the most critical aspect.
*   **Layout & Typography:** Match the visual structure, font styles, and spacing.
*   **Performance:** The experience should be smooth and responsive.
*   **Overall Atmosphere:** Capture the "feel" of the original site.

## Technical Requirements

*   You are free to use any modern front-end framework (React, Vue, Svelte) or vanilla JavaScript.
*   Animation libraries like GSAP, Framer Motion, or ScrollTrigger are encouraged.
*   The code must be your own.

## Deliverables

1.  **Source Code:** Commit all your final source code to this repository.
2.  **Live Deployment:** Add the link to your live, deployed solution in the `report.md` file.

We are excited to see your interpretation and how you tackle the challenge.
